## Branching Out

Thanks for taking a look at Branching Out - a minimalist game about leaving home.

### Requirements

* WebGL capable browser
* A mouse (touch support coming soon)

### How to play

Click and hold near the structure to extend your branch. Release the mouse when you're happy with its position.

Build up your network of branches, collecting friends as you go. Win by collecting all the friends - the more direct the route, the higher the score!
